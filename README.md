# Exploring the Potential Application of FDA-Approved Antibody Therapies Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab in Additional Cancers
## The KSQ: Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore using the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?

First, I will start by explaining a few important terms:

1. Cancer cell lines are in-vitro model systems derived from patient cancer cells, used for understanding the mechanisms of specific cancers, conducting research, and aiding in drug discovery. These cell lines are essential in cancer research, allowing scientists to study cancer behavior, test new treatments, and explore potential therapeutic targets in a controlled laboratory environment.
2. scRNA stands for single-cell RNA sequencing, it is used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells. This sequencing allows for the study of gene expression profiles of individual cells as opposed to bulk sequencing which gives an average profile of all the cells in the sample. This technique is useful for studying cellular diversity within a tissue, understanding the roles of different cell types, and identifying rare cell populations that might be missed in bulk RNA sequencing.
The significance of scRNA-seq in understanding cancer cell lines:
- Tumor Heterogeneity: Reveals diverse gene expression profiles within cancer cell populations, aiding in understanding tumor progression and drug resistance.
- Rare Cell Populations: Identifies rare cells, such as cancer stem cells, that contribute to tumor initiation and therapy resistance.
- Drug Resistance: Uncovers resistant subclones and adaptive responses to treatments, guiding more effective therapeutic strategies.
- Pathway Analysis: Discovers key signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets for personalized medicine.
- Microenvironment Interactions: Studies interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, providing insights into tumor biology.
- Metastasis: Tracks gene expression signatures linked to metastatic potential and cancer progression.
3. Antibody therapy refers to the use of antibodies to directly kill target cells, block harmful interactions, or mark cells for destruction by the immune system.
  - Monoclonal antibody: Engineered antibody that targets specific antigens in cancer cells/pathogens. eg: Trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer.
  - Bispecific Antibodies: Designed to bind to two different antigens simultaneously, enhancing targeting and immune response. Example: Blinatumomab, used for certain leukemias.
  - Conjugated Antibodies: Antibodies linked to a drug or toxin that delivers a therapeutic agent directly to the target cells. Example: Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) for lymphoma.
  - Checkpoint Inhibitors: Antibodies that block proteins on immune cells or cancer cells that inhibit the immune response. Example: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for various cancers.
  - Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): Combine antibodies with cytotoxic drugs to deliver the drug directly to cancer cells. Example: Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) for HER2-positive breast cancer.
## Understanding HER2 and VEGF
#### HER2 (Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2)
- HER2 is a protein that is involved in the growth, division, and repair of cells. It is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family and is encoded by the ERBB2 gene. HER2 is primarily known for its role in breast cancer, where it is overexpressed in approximately 20-30% of cases.
- HER2-positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive and have a higher likelihood of recurrence.
- However, targeted therapies, such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Pertuzumab have been developed specifically to inhibit the HER2 protein, improving the prognosis for patients with HER2-positive cancers.
- Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 is a protein that normally resides in the membranes of cells and is encoded by the ERBB2 gene. ERBB is abbreviated from erythroblastic oncogene B, a gene originally isolated from the avian genome. The human protein is also frequently referred to as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) or CD340 (cluster of differentiation 340).
- The ErbB family consists of four individual plasma membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinases. One of which is erbB-2, and the other members are erbB-1, erbB-3 (neuregulin-binding; lacks kinase domain), and erbB-4. All four contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain that can interact with a multitude of signaling molecules and exhibit both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activity. Notably, no ligands for HER2 have yet been identified. HER2 can heterodimerize with any of the other three receptors and is considered to be the preferred dimerization partner of the other ErbB receptors. Dimerization results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain of the receptors and initiates a variety of signaling pathways.

#### Signal transduction
Signaling pathways activated by HER2 include:
- mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
- phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/Akt)
- phospholipase C Î³
- protein kinase C (PKC)
- Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
In summary, signaling through the ErbB family of receptors promotes cell proliferation and opposes apoptosis, and therefore must be tightly regulated to prevent uncontrolled cell growth from occurring.

#### VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor)
- VEGF is a protein that plays a critical role in the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of blood vessels. VEGF stimulates the growth of blood vessels by promoting the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, which line the interior surface of the blood vessel.
- VEGF is particularly important in normal physiological processes like wound healing and the formation of the vascular system during embryonic development, however, it also plays a role in pathological conditions such as cancer.
- Tumors can secrete VEGF to promote the growth of new blood vessels that supply tumors with oxygen and nutrients, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis.
- VEGF-A has been implicated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Numerous studies show a decreased overall survival and disease-free survival in those tumors overexpressing VEGF. The overexpression of VEGF-A may be an early step in the process of metastasis, a step that is involved in the "angiogenic" switch.
- Because of its role in cancer, VEGF is a target for anti-angiogenic therapies. Drugs like bevacizumab are designed to inhibit VEGF activity, thereby preventing the growth of blood vessels that tumors need to grow and spread.

## Understanding the mechanism of action of the given two antibodies: Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab
#### TRASTUZUMAB
Trastuzumab, sold under the brand name Herceptin among others, is a monoclonal antibody used to treat breast cancer and stomach cancer. It is specifically used for cancer that is HER2 receptor-positive. It may be used by itself or together with other chemotherapy medication. Trastuzumab is given by slow injection into a vein and injection just under the skin.
