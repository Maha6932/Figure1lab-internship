# Exploring the Potential Application of FDA-Approved Antibody Therapies Trastuzumab and Bevacizumab in Additional Cancers
## The KSQ: Using available scRNA-seq data from cancer cell lines, how would you explore using the following FDA-approved antibody therapies in additional cancers?

First, I will start by explaining a few important terms:

1. Cancer cell lines are in-vitro model systems derived from patient cancer cells, used for understanding the mechanisms of specific cancers, conducting research, and aiding in drug discovery. These cell lines are essential in cancer research, allowing scientists to study cancer behavior, test new treatments, and explore potential therapeutic targets in a controlled laboratory environment.
2. scRNA stands for single-cell RNA sequencing, it is used to analyze the gene expression of individual cells. This sequencing allows for the study of gene expression profiles of individual cells as opposed to bulk sequencing which gives an average profile of all the cells in the sample. This technique is useful for studying cellular diversity within a tissue, understanding the roles of different cell types, and identifying rare cell populations that might be missed in bulk RNA sequencing.
The significance of scRNA-seq in understanding cancer cell lines:
- Tumor Heterogeneity: Reveals diverse gene expression profiles within cancer cell populations, aiding in understanding tumor progression and drug resistance.
- Rare Cell Populations: Identifies rare cells, such as cancer stem cells, that contribute to tumor initiation and therapy resistance.
- Drug Resistance: Uncovers resistant subclones and adaptive responses to treatments, guiding more effective therapeutic strategies.
- Pathway Analysis: Discovers key signaling pathways and potential therapeutic targets for personalized medicine.
- Microenvironment Interactions: Studies interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, providing insights into tumor biology.
- Metastasis: Tracks gene expression signatures linked to metastatic potential and cancer progression.
3. Antibody therapy refers to the use of antibodies to directly kill target cells, block harmful interactions, or mark cells for destruction by the immune system.
  - Monoclonal antibody: Engineered antibody that targets specific antigens in cancer cells/pathogens. eg: Trastuzumab for HER2 positive breast cancer.
  - Bispecific Antibodies: Designed to bind to two different antigens simultaneously, enhancing targeting and immune response. Example: Blinatumomab, used for certain leukemias.
  - Conjugated Antibodies: Antibodies linked to a drug or toxin that delivers a therapeutic agent directly to the target cells. Example: Adcetris (brentuximab vedotin) for lymphoma.
  - Checkpoint Inhibitors: Antibodies that block proteins on immune cells or cancer cells that inhibit the immune response. Example: Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) for various cancers.
  - Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs): Combine antibodies with cytotoxic drugs to deliver the drug directly to cancer cells. Example: Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) for HER2-positive breast cancer.
